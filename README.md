React Social Network

This is an in depth application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node).  
Some other technologies used were: Mongoose, Redux, Validator, Bcrypt, React-Redux, React Thunk, Gravatar, Concurrently, Passport, JsonWebtoken, Axios, React-Router-Dom

Mongoose makes the calls from node to the MongoDB.

Redux makes the information available to different pages.

Validator validates the user's information to make sure they are the profile's user.

Bcrypt gives the user a bearer token to access the profile pages while logged in.

React-Redux links React to the Redux Program. 

Gravatar  holds the profiles photo.

Concurrently fires up two servers for local hosts using one command instead of having different servers running.

Passport authenticates requests.

JsonWebtoken  holds the user data in a string.

Axios makes the calls from the front end to the back end routes that are set up.

React-Router-Dom is the router for all of the pages in React.

The project was to learn how to buil a social media website similar to Linkedin. The user can register with an email and a password, and use that info to login.  The user's profile can be filled with personal information, schooling, work history, and skills. It will also link to their Github account and show the last five projects they entered.  They can also make posts to their pages, like facebook.  They see everyone elses profile and comment or like any of their posts. Posts can also be unliked and deleted.
